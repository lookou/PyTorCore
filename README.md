# PyTorCore
Name offer by ChatGPT. And the prompt: 帮我起一个名字：基于tornado的python 服务框架 

The other options are: TorPyServ, PyTornadoRex, TornaSphere, TornaLink, TornadoBolt, TornaCore, TornadoNest.

## What is PyTorCore
A Python skeleton like Flask, aims to make python server development more easy and fast.

# Motivation
After many years of writing python and tornado to compose different backend service. I finally would like to share my python skeleton which is based on tornado. 

I find it is much more clean and strait to write service much more than flask. and I share the code here. Wish this would help you.
